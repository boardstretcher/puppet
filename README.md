THESE SCRIPTS WORK!!

Tested on Centos 6.4 x86_64 - October 28, 2013

I made them because the documentation of installation process for Puppet Community is frankly fucking laughable. 
And worse yet, its a RUBY program, so the debugging process is deplorable. So If you are ready to tear your hair 
out because you need and actual working install, which is asking for a lot from Community Puppet, then these 
are the scripts you need.

You are welcome.
